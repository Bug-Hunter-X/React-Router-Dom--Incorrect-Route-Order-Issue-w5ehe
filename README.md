This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom v6: Incorrect route order.  The example showcases how defining a catch-all route (`/*`) before other specific routes leads to the catch-all route intercepting all navigation, even to other defined paths. The solution demonstrates how to correct this by placing the catch-all route at the end of the route definitions.
